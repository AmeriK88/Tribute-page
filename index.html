          Alex Honnold was born in Sacramento, California, to community college professors Dierdre Wolownick (b. 1953) and Charles Honnold (1949–2004). His father is of German ancestry and his mother is of Polish ancestry 1. Alex graduated from Mira Loma High School in Sacramento 1. He started climbing when he was 11 years old and at the age of 18, he dropped out of the University of California, Berkeley, where he was studying engineering, to focus on climbing full-time 1. Between climbs, he runs or hikes to stay in shape 1. He lives in a van, spending less than a thousand dollars a month, which allows him to climb all the time 1.
